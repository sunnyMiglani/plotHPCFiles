# Plotting BlueCrystal Out Files

## This was created for use in the High Performance Computing assignment in 2017.

## Overall process is the following.

1. Grep away the data from the outfiles
2. Copy grep'd data into excel / whatever
3. Copy those files into an online Json converter (linked in the files)
4. Run the program

### Obvious Statement:

Since you're putting the data in excel you could almost definitely plot it in Excel.
I dislike Excel's plotting format and I'm more used to numpy plot so I used this.
